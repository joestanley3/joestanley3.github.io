![Sharing a birthday with  my nephew.](../about.jpg#left "Sharing a birthday with my one year old nephew. We are seated at a picnic table, each with a cupcake in front of us while we quizzically try ice cream.")I'm based in Richmond VA, where I live with my partner and our cat, Nutmeg. I enjoy waffles, wordplay, and worker's rights. When I'm not exchanging labor for capital as a product manager, I play and design games, notably tabletop roleplaying games (TTPRGs). Otherwise, my time typically goes toward reading, trying new foods, and avoiding exercise.

**Some random facts, in no order:**

+ I grew up in a family that worked two farms, neither of which they owned.
+ I've lived in NYC, one of few places you can go 24 hours from work to parties to after parties to after-after parties to bars to morning diners and back to work. I don't recommend that type of life after your twenties.
+ I got to be part of the NASDAQ bell ringing ceremony as part of a company's acquisition.
+ As a child, I had my head split open by a homemade axe some friends and I made together.
+ Before I got into tech, I worked in politics (specifically on issues of redistricting reform, renewable energy, and fiscal policy).
+ My senator at the time bought me my first legal beer.
+ Our bedroom is in a finished portion of our basement, which I refer to dramatically as *The Undercroft* to my partner's eternal derision.
+ Modern tech has made a tragedy of the digital commons, and I try to improve it in some small way daily.
