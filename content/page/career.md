### My Product Philosophy

>You don't become a good ~~Communist~~ *Product Manager* by going to meetings or memorizing the [Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). You do it on the streets. You do it with your fists. The rest is bullshit and you know it.

*[Gregor Anghel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrade_Detective)*


### What I Do

The theme of my professional life has been:
1. working at the intersection of people and technology, 
2. usually in highly-regulated industries,
3. to build the foundation for the next stage of the organization. 

It's about getting to the type of place you can't reach by improving business as usual; the place you can only get by getting a lot of knowledgeable people in the room, describing a target, and learning why we can't achieve it today.

Inevitably, a constraint fundamental to how the company works will be uncovered, and my job shifts to eliminating that constraint. This usually takes the form of building a modern platform to replace something that hasn't been touched in years, if not decades.

It's slow, exhausting, and game-changing. And I love it despite myself.
