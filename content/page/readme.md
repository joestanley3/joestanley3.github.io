### Me, In Brief

I'm based in Richmond VA, where I live with my partner and our cat, Nutmeg. I enjoy waffles, wordplay, and worker's rights. When I'm not exchanging labor for capital as a product manager, I play and design games, notably tabletop roleplaying games (TTPRGs). Otherwise, my time typically goes toward reading, small acts of resistance to encroaching fascism, and avoiding exercise.

### Career TL;DR: 

>You don't become a good ~~Communist~~ *Product Manager* by going to meetings or memorizing the [Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). You do it on the streets. You do it with your fists. The rest is bullshit and you know it.

### Career

The theme of my professional life has been:
1. working at the intersection of people and technology, 
2. usually in highly-regulated industries,
3. to build the foundation for the next stage of the organization. 

It's about getting to the type of place you can't reach by improving business as usual; the place you can only get by getting a lot of knowledgeable people in the room, describing a target, and figuring out what must be true to get there.

Inevitably, a constraint fundamental to how the company works will be uncovered, and my job shifts to eliminating that constraint. This usually takes the form of building a modern platform to replace something that hasn't been touched in years, if not decades.

It's slow, exhausting, and transformative. I love it.
