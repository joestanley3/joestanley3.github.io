About Me
I&rsquo;m based in Richmond VA, where I live with my partner and our cat, Nutmeg. I enjoy waffles, wordplay, and worker&rsquo;s rights. When I&rsquo;m not exchanging labor for capital as a product manager, I play and design games, notably tabletop roleplaying games (TTPRGs). Otherwise, my time typically goes toward reading, finding joy in small acts of resistance to encroaching fascism, and avoiding exercise.
My Product Philosophy

You don&rsquo;t become a good Communist Product Manager by going to meetings or memorizing the Manifesto. You do it on the streets. You do it with your fists. The rest is bullshit and you know it.">
